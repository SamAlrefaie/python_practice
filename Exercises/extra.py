# Step 1: Create a function called `allowed_to_vote` that takes in a `age` as an argument
# TODO: return (not print!) a boolean stating whether `age` is old enough to vote (18+)
# NOTE: Use an if/else statment



# Step 2: Ask the user for their age



# Step 3: Call the function with the age they entered



# Step 4: Depending on the restult, print out whether they are allowed to vote or not



# To check if it's working, run this file and enter your age and see if you can vote!

## Python Practice

1. `Clone` this Repository to be able work on the challenges on your computer (Unsure how? See in the [Version Control with Git and GitHub](https://redi-school.github.io/ber-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/docs/git/git_and_github_desktop/) lesson)
2. Open the folder in `Visual Studio Code` (one click in GitHub Desktop)

_Open the **Exercises** Folder_
→ we will again practice working with strings, lists, dictionaries, conditions and loops

1. Start with the `strings.py` file and try to solve the included challenges.

2. Continue with the `lists.py` file and try to solve the included challenges.

3. Move on to the `dictionaries.py` file and try to solve the included challenges.

## Optional

_Open the **Rock-Paper-Scissors** Folder_
→ Terminal Game

1. Read the instructions on top of the `rock-paper-scissors.py` file.
2. Implement your solution step by step.

→ To start playing (or check in between if your code is doing what you want it to do) click on the file in the left panel and select `Run Python File in Terminal`
